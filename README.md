# HOW TO DOWNLOAD PROPERLY
- you must atleast have git installed
- then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/lua-gods/GNs-Avatar-4 --recurse-submodules
```
but if you already git cloned and and came back crawling here for not reading this lmao, run these:
```
git submodule init 
git submodule update
```
