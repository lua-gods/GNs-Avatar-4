A code ready Figura Avatar template

## Notes
- to avoid using too many init instructions and loading unused scripts, only the `main.lua` file is triggered at initialization.
- Lua Language Server hinting is disabled to clear up space on the editor, simply hover over the variable to get its type instead.
- Submodules are not ignored.
